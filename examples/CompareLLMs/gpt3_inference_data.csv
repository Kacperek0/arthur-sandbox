The process of filtering waste from the kidneys involves three main steps: glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption, and tubular secretion. Glomerular filtration is the process of filtering blood as it passes through the glomerulus in the nephron. This separates waste products and excess fluids from the blood. Tubular reabsorption is the process by which the renal tubules remove useful substances such as glucose and amino acids from the filtrate and return them to the bloodstream. Tubular secretion is the process by which excess substances such as hydrogen ions and drugs are transported from the bloodstream to the filtrate in the renal tubules.",-1
