    "\n",
    "Onboarding is the process of setting up your model to be monitored by Arthur. You specify the type of data your model ingests, send a reference dataset to provide a baseline of the distribution of your data, and you configure additional settings among the services Arthur offers.\n",

    "**Arthur does not need your model object itself to monitor performance - only predictions are required**\n",
    "\n",
    "All you need to monitor your model with Arthur is to upload the predictions your model makes: Arthur computes analytics about your model based on that prediction data. This data can be computed directly by your model in a script or notebook like this one to be uploaded to the platform, or can be fetched from an external database to be sent to Arthur.\n",

These can include conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, lung cancer, and others. The inflammation and swelling can narrow the airways, making it harder for air to flow in and out of the lungs. Damage to the lung tissues can reduce their ability to expand and contract, which can also make breathing difficult. Additionally, excess mucus or fluid in the lungs can further narrow the airways and make it hard to breathe. These factors can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, and fatigue.\"},\n",
