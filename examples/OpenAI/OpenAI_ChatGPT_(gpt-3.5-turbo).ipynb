These can include conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, lung cancer, and others. The inflammation and swelling can narrow the airways, making it harder for air to flow in and out of the lungs. Damage to the lung tissues can reduce their ability to expand and contract, which can also make breathing difficult. Additionally, excess mucus or fluid in the lungs can further narrow the airways and make it hard to breathe. These factors can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, and fatigue.\"},\n",

Friction is caused by the interaction between the surfaces of two objects that are in contact with each other, and it acts in the opposite direction to the direction of motion. In the case of a car braking, the friction is between the tires and the road surface, which slows down the car and eventually brings it to a stop.\n",

The PNS is made up of afferent nerves, which receive and relay sensory information from stimuli such as temperature, pain, taste, and touch to the CNS, and efferent nerves, which transport signals from the CNS to the muscles and organs. Cranial nerves and spinal nerves form part of the peripheral nervous system.\n",

A vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction, and it can be represented graphically by an arrow. In the case of a force, the direction of the vector represents the direction in which the force is applied.\n",
