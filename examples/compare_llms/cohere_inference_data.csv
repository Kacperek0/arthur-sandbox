The simplest organic compounds are known as ""alkanes."" 

Organic compounds are molecules that contain carbon and hydrogen atoms. Alkanes are the simplest type of organic compounds because they contain only hydrogen and carbon atoms that are connected by single covalent bonds. The general formula for an alkane is CnH2n+2, where n is the number of carbon atoms in the molecule. 

Hydrocarbons are a larger class of organic compounds that include not only alkanes, but also alkenes, alkynes, and aromatic compounds. They are molecules that consist only of hydrogen and carbon atoms. However, hydrocarbons can have double or triple bonds between carbon atoms, while alkanes only have single bonds. 

In summary, the simplest organic compounds are alkanes, which are a subset of the larger class of hydrocarbons.",2

You are right, my answer is not specific enough for the question asked. The wheels of a car are turned by the power generated by the engine. This power is transmitted to the wheels through the drive train, which includes the transmission, differential, and axles. When the driver presses the accelerator pedal, it sends a signal to the engine to burn more fuel and generate more power. This power is then transferred to the wheels through the drive train, causing them to turn and propel the car forward. The steering wheel is the component that the driver uses to control the direction of the wheels. So, the engine generates power, which is transmitted through the drive train to the wheels, and the steering wheel is used to control their direction. I hope this answer is helpful! 8",8
