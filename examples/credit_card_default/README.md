# Credit Card Default

This example model is based on the 
[UCI Taiwan Credit dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients). 
With this dataset, we use a binary classifier for predicting credit default risk from various attributes about payment 
information and customer demographics. 

## Setup

You'll need a Python environment in which you can run the `credit_card_default.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. If you're new to 
Jupyter consider uploading this example folder to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and running it 
from there, or you can [install JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) 
in your Python environment.
