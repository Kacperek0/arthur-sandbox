    "\n",
    "Onboarding is the process of setting up your model to be monitored by Arthur. You specify the type of data your model ingests, send a reference dataset to provide a baseline of the distribution of your data, and you configure additional settings among the services Arthur offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Arthur does not need your model object itself to monitor performance - only predictions are required**\n",
    "\n",
    "All you need to monitor your model with Arthur is to upload the predictions your model makes: Arthur computes analytics about your model based on that prediction data. This data can be computed directly by your model in a script or notebook like this one to be uploaded to the platform, or can be fetched from an external database to be sent to Arthur.\n",

    "\n",

    "## Model Monitoring and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Once onboarding is complete and you have inferences uploaded to the platform, you can use Arthur to get model monitoring insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will analyze the token-likelihood sequences produced by the model, measuring their length and their spikiness in changes in token likelihood from one token to the next."

Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.\"\\n\"You\\'re put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it\\'s difficult, it\\'s difficult to get away from it. It\\'s like every man for himself, there\\'s nothing.\"\\nMarc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing.\\n\"You feel safe, you got hot food, you\\'ve got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It\\'s a constructive, helpful atmosphere,\" he said.\\nTom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available.\\n\"We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven\\'t got accommodation and haven\\'t got provision,\" he said.\\n\"I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don\\'t delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can\\'t.\\n\"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen.\"\\nA Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence.\\nIt added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.',\n",

The latest findings help to explain why.\\nHowever, Dr Longo said people should not rush off and crash diet.\\nHe told the BBC: \"It boils down to do not try this at home, this is so much more sophisticated than people realise.\"\\nHe said people could \"get into trouble\" with their health if it was done without medical guidance.\\nDr Emily Burns, research communications manager at Diabetes UK, said: \"This is potentially very exciting news, but we need to see if the results hold true in humans before we\\'ll know more about what it means for people with diabetes.\\n\"People with type-1 and type-2 diabetes would benefit immensely from treatments that can repair or regenerate insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.\"\\nFollow James on Twitter.',\n",

       "[{'document': 'Prison Link Cymru had 1,099 referrals in 2015-16 and said some ex-offenders were living rough for up to a year before finding suitable accommodation.\\nWorkers at the charity claim investment in housing would be cheaper than jailing homeless repeat offenders.\\nThe Welsh Government said more people than ever were getting help to address housing problems.\\nChanges to the Housing Act in Wales, introduced in 2015, removed the right for prison leavers to be given priority for accommodation.\\nPrison Link Cymru, which helps people find accommodation after their release, said things were generally good for women because issues such as children or domestic violence were now considered.\\nHowever, the same could not be said for men, the charity said, because issues which often affect them, such as post traumatic stress disorder or drug dependency, were often viewed as less of a priority.\\nAndrew Stevens, who works in Welsh prisons trying to secure housing for prison leavers, said the need for accommodation was \"chronic\".\\n\"There\\'s a desperate need for it, finding suitable accommodation for those leaving prison there is just a lack of it everywhere,\" he said.\\n\"It could take six months to a year, without a lot of help they could be on the streets for six months.\\n\"When you think of the consequences of either being on the street, especially with the cold weather at the moment or you may have a roof over your head, sometimes there is only one choice.\"\\nMr Stevens believes building more one-bedroom flats could help ease the problem.\\n\"The average price is a hundred pounds a week to keep someone in a rented flat, prison is a lot more than that so I would imagine it would save the public purse quite a few pounds,\" he said.\\nOfficial figures show 830 one-bedroom properties were built in the year to March 2016, of an overall total of 6,900 new properties in Wales.\\nMarc, 50, who has been in and out of prison for the past 20 years for burglary offences, said he struggled to find accommodation each time he was released.\\nHe said he would ask himself: \"Where am I going to stay? Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.\"\\n\"You\\'re put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it\\'s difficult, it\\'s difficult to get away from it. It\\'s like every man for himself, there\\'s nothing.\"\\nMarc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing.\\n\"You feel safe, you got hot food, you\\'ve got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It\\'s a constructive, helpful atmosphere,\" he said.\\nTom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available.\\n\"We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven\\'t got accommodation and haven\\'t got provision,\" he said.\\n\"I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don\\'t delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can\\'t.\\n\"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen.\"\\nA Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence.\\nIt added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.',\n",

The latest findings help to explain why.\\nHowever, Dr Longo said people should not rush off and crash diet.\\nHe told the BBC: \"It boils down to do not try this at home, this is so much more sophisticated than people realise.\"\\nHe said people could \"get into trouble\" with their health if it was done without medical guidance.\\nDr Emily Burns, research communications manager at Diabetes UK, said: \"This is potentially very exciting news, but we need to see if the results hold true in humans before we\\'ll know more about what it means for people with diabetes.\\n\"People with type-1 and type-2 diabetes would benefit immensely from treatments that can repair or regenerate insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.\"\\nFollow James on Twitter.',\n",

       " 'ground_truth_data': {'summary': 'Prison Link Cymru had 1,099 referrals in 2015-16 and said some ex-offenders were living rough for up to a year before finding suitable accommodation.\\nWorkers at the charity claim investment in housing would be cheaper than jailing homeless repeat offenders.\\nThe Welsh Government said more people than ever were getting help to address housing problems.\\nChanges to the Housing Act in Wales, introduced in 2015, removed the right for prison leavers to be given priority for accommodation.\\nPrison Link Cymru, which helps people find accommodation after their release, said things were generally good for women because issues such as children or domestic violence were now considered.\\nHowever, the same could not be said for men, the charity said, because issues which often affect them, such as post traumatic stress disorder or drug dependency, were often viewed as less of a priority.\\nAndrew Stevens, who works in Welsh prisons trying to secure housing for prison leavers, said the need for accommodation was \"chronic\".\\n\"There\\'s a desperate need for it, finding suitable accommodation for those leaving prison there is just a lack of it everywhere,\" he said.\\n\"It could take six months to a year, without a lot of help they could be on the streets for six months.\\n\"When you think of the consequences of either being on the street, especially with the cold weather at the moment or you may have a roof over your head, sometimes there is only one choice.\"\\nMr Stevens believes building more one-bedroom flats could help ease the problem.\\n\"The average price is a hundred pounds a week to keep someone in a rented flat, prison is a lot more than that so I would imagine it would save the public purse quite a few pounds,\" he said.\\nOfficial figures show 830 one-bedroom properties were built in the year to March 2016, of an overall total of 6,900 new properties in Wales.\\nMarc, 50, who has been in and out of prison for the past 20 years for burglary offences, said he struggled to find accommodation each time he was released.\\nHe said he would ask himself: \"Where am I going to stay? Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.\"\\n\"You\\'re put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it\\'s difficult, it\\'s difficult to get away from it. It\\'s like every man for himself, there\\'s nothing.\"\\nMarc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing.\\n\"You feel safe, you got hot food, you\\'ve got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It\\'s a constructive, helpful atmosphere,\" he said.\\nTom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available.\\n\"We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven\\'t got accommodation and haven\\'t got provision,\" he said.\\n\"I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don\\'t delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can\\'t.\\n\"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen.\"\\nA Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence.\\nIt added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.'},\n",
